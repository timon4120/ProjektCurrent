info.notifChol = Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and even death if untreated.\nIt is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae. The disease is most\ncommon in places with poor sanitation, crowding, war, and famine.

In late 2017, Chinese scientists traced the virus through \nthe intermediary of civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in Yunnan province. No cases of the first SARS-CoV have been\nreported worldwide since 2004.
info.notifDzum = The Black Death was an epidemic of bubonic plague, a disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis that circulates among wild\nrodents where they live in great numbers and density. Such an area is called a 'plague focus' or a 'plague reservoir'.
info.notifCorona = The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, or simply Covid) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n(SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei\nprovince, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronaviruspandemic.
